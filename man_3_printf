.SH NAME
_printf \- custom implementation of formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.PP
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B _printf()
function produces output according to a 
.I format
string. The function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.

This function writes the output under the control of a 
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character 
.B %
and ends with a 
.I conversion specifier
.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS
The following conversion specifiers are supported:

.TP
.B c
Prints a single character.

.TP
.B s
Prints a string.

.TP
.B %
Prints a percent sign.

.TP
.B d, i
Prints a signed integer.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH AUXILIARY FUNCTIONS
The following auxiliary functions are used internally:

.TP
.B print_char(va_list args)
Prints a single character.

.B print_string(va_list args)
Prints a string.
